AI based audio language recognizer
India has great diversity in languages. Many Indians can speak two or more languages such as English, Hindi, Marathi etc. Running a language speech AI model in real time requires identifying the language first. Hence, developing an AI based audio language recognizer which can accept user voice in real time and display the language spoken will be useful. 
In this work, we segmented audio into 1sec chunks then preprocessed it to get melspectrogram images using librosa. We proposed our CNN model to classify speech samples into 3 languages (English Hindi, and Marathi).
